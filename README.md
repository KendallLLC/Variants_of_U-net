# Variants_of_U-net
Implementations of different variations of U-net - adding deconv layers, dense net variant (still working on it) and including skip connections for the task of **generating binary masks**.

#### Obeservations:
> - The skip connection variant gave best result among the three models
> - Introducing skip connections led to ~3x improvement in speed
